Lab overview

A composite data type is any data type that comprises primitive data types. If you like food, you can visualize a composite data type as a turducken, which is a dish that consists of a chicken that is stuffed into a duck, which is stuffed into a turkey. In this lab, you will create a data type that consists of a string that is in a dictionary, which is in a list.

In this lab, you will:

    Use numeric data types
    Use string data types
    Use the dictionary data type
    Use the list data type
    Use a for loop
    Use the print() function
    Use the if statement
    Use the else statement
    Use the import statement
